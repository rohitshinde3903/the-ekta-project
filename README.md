## 📖 Overview

This is a **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org)** project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).  
It’s more than just another web app — it’s **crafted to impress**, **built to scale**, and **styled to inspire**.

Because at Stones Web, we don’t just build websites.  
We **design digital experiences** that make users say *“Wow, who made this?”* — and that’s where *you* point to this repo. 😎

## 🛠 Getting Started

First, run the development server:

\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
\`\`\`

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and watch your creation come alive.

Want to tweak something?  
Open \`app/page.tsx\` and start editing. The page will auto-update faster than your coffee cools down. ☕
